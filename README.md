Content Strategy Analysis involves examining the processes of content creation, publication, distribution, and audience interaction to achieve targeted objectives such as increasing engagement, expanding brand visibility, boosting viewership, or generating revenue. To analyze Netflix's content strategy, we require data on content titles, type (movie or show), genre, language, and release information—including date, day of the week, and season—to assess the timing and positioning of releases. Additionally, viewership metrics such as hours watched are essential for evaluating audience engagement and content performance.

## Problem Statement
The objective is to examine Netflix’s content strategy to understand how elements such as content type, language, release season, and timing influence viewership trends. By pinpointing top-performing content and its release timing, the analysis seeks to reveal how Netflix strategically drives audience engagement year-round.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on Netflix content released globally in 2023, covering details such as title, release date, language, content type (movie or show), availability status, and viewership hours. It enables analysis of viewership trends based on factors like content type, release season, language, and day of release. Viewership hours are used as an indicator of each title's popularity and audience engagement:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Title | Title of the Show/Movie |
| Available Globally? | Yes/No |
| Release Date | Date of release of the Show/Movie |
| Hours Viewed | Numeric value seperated by ',' |
| Language Indicator | Language of the Show/Movie |
| Content Type | Show/Movie |

## Technologies Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas

## Analysis Procedure

## Conclusion
Netflix’s content strategy focuses on maximizing viewership by strategically timing releases and offering diverse content. Shows tend to outperform movies in terms of viewership, with notable spikes in December and June, indicating purposeful scheduling during these high-engagement periods. The Fall season emerges as the peak for audience interaction. Most content is released on Fridays, aligning with the goal of capturing weekend viewers, and viewership patterns reflect this trend. Although the volume of releases remains relatively consistent throughout the year, fluctuations in viewership suggest a deliberate emphasis on high-impact titles and optimal release timing rather than quantity.
